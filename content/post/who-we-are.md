*We meet people, see them every day, we say hello, but we don't really know them. We call them friends, but they're not.*

*We say hi, we chit-chat, maybe we laugh, maybe we don't, but we don't know each other struggles and dreams and fears.*

*We build a thick wall around ourselves, to protect our hearts. Living in our own castles.*

#### *What is that we're afraid of?*

> *So afraid to be connected. So afraid to touch a heart and be touched.*
> *Since when have we lived our life based on fear?*
>
> *Since when have we lost our abilities to connect with each other?*
> *Walking and living in aluminum foil wrappings.*

*We put our heart in a steel casket, put a lock so no one can ever touch and tear it again. No wonder you're lonely..*

*Life is about the connections you make with other people. It's about sharing the air you breathe and the dreams you dream.*

*Life is about enjoying the laughter, the tears, the hurt, the happiness, the pain, the joy, and everything else in between.*

*Don't be afraid, love and get hurt, laugh and cry. Close your eyes, feel everything. Don't be afraid, this is life..*

*When we are aware that we might die tomorrow, all your hurt is irrelevant. We should be grateful we can still feel hurt.*

*When we are aware that life is the greatest gift of the universe, we would want to feel all there is to feel..*
