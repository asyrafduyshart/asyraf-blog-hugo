### The Universe
- The universe is very extreme and stupendous large but finite, a human cannot even grasp the sense of the real scale how big the universe is.

- Universe has no end, the end on one side is the beginning on the other side just like PacMan video game

- We're not alone in this universe, we just lonely.

- There is alien life out there probably tons of them, simply because there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one billion trillion) of stars out there, almost all of them had a planet orbiting.

- We're not seeing any sign of intelligent alien life yet because we just still too early to begin, (the search just begin 30 years ago, which nothing compared to the age of the universe) alien life maybe already reach us, but thousand or million years ago.

- The universe exists because of Big Bang and Big Bang itself was an endless cycle of inflation and contraction. One day the universe expansion gonna stop and then begin to shrink into the point of so small that causing the next big bang, all with a new & very different set of rules of physics

- Blackhole is a tunnel to the next dimension or another universe

- Multiverse existed because simply we had 11 dimensions

- Gravity was just an illusion of time travel like Einstein describe in Theory of General Relativity

- The universe had no beginning, the concept of time(begin/end) was just applied on our own universe

- The reality of space-time in the universe was really different from what human feel. The human sense of time was just an illusion created by evolution to detect the difference of movements.

- Time travel to the past is not possible but we can travel to the past of the alternate universe which is very similar to our universe past

- Dark energy one day could be explained by a simple equation like E = mc2

- Intelligent life is just a universe trying to understand itself

- In the end, we will become one with the universe as a cosmic consciousness

- I believe universe exists independent of our own phaneron.

- We see the universe through a key hole, just a small fraction of it.

- There is a single universal law that guided everything on this universe, just by one single equation (just like Einstein believed : The Theory of Everything)

### Life

- Life on earth begins at the ocean.

- Life is an inevitable accident, given infinite amount of time and space and random chances, life will happen, one way or another.

- Life totally guided by synapses and chemical reaction, which affected by certain stimulus.

- Evolution is true because is proven by science and experiment and make sense to explain how is life could possibly this diverse on every corner of the earth.

- I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in human evolution. We became too self-aware, nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. 

- We are creatures that should not exist by natural law.

- Human is the only creature that measures time. We know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on our wall or the dashboard of our car. We have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around us, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays. Human alone measures time. Human alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, *human alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out.*

### Contemporary Belief

- I believe in God, but not a personified anthropomorphic God.

- God is another term of cosmic level of consciousness, incomprehensible by the human mind.

- We're part of God's debris.

- Religion was just a ritual and tradition, I follow any religious ritual that makes me wonder and satisfied

- Religion was created by human

- Mostly the 'God' was created by human to answer questions they don't know, like why there is Thunder? We don't know, therefore Zeus. How's the Universe exists? We don't know, therefore God.

- Mostly God that human believe was just a delusion.

- Human wanted to be eternal, so religion could be powerful to answer what happen after we die.

- What we feel after we die is the same feeling before we were born.

### Morality

- The question of moral could be answered by science.

    *Human beings seek to maximize something we choose to call “well-being” (although it might be called “utility” or “happiness” or “flourishing” or something else). The amount of well-being in a single person is a function of what is happening in that person’s brain, or at least in their body as a whole. That function can in principle be empirically measured. The total amount of well-being is a function of what happens in all of the human brains in the world, which again can in principle be measured. The job of morality is to specify what that function is, measure it, and derive conditions in the world under which it is maximized.*

- Morality came from the desire to increase pleasure (or well-being) and to decrease suffering.

- Treat others the way I wanted to be treated.

- Karma doesn't exists, consequences does. Don't do things because karma will return, don't do things because of the consequences after.

- There is no single ultimate morality that justified all, just a moral landscape depends on culture and belief.
