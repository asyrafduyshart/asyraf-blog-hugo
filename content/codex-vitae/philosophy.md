### The Universe
- Universe is very extremely abd stupendously large but finite, human cannot even grasp the sense of the real scale of how big the universe

- Universe has no end, the end on one side is the beginning of the other side just like PacMan video game

- We're not alone in this universe, we just lonely.

- There is alien life out there probably tons of them, simply because there is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one billion trillion) of stars out there, almost all of them had planet orbitting them.

- We're not seing any sign of inteligent alien life yet because we just still too ealy to begun, (the seacrh just begin 30 years ago, which nothing compared to age of the universe) alien life maybe already reach us, but thousand or million years ago.

- Universe exist because of Big Bang and Big Bang itself was an endless cycle of inflation and contraction. One day the univere expansion gonna stop and then begin to shrink into the point of so small that causing the next big bang, all with new & very different set of rules of physics

- Blackhole is a tunnel to next dimension or another universe

- Multiverse was exist because simply we had 11 dimensions

- Gravity was just an illution of time travel, like Einstein describe in Theory of General Relativity

- Universe had no beginning, the concept of time was just applied on our own universe

- The reality of space-time in the universe was really different with what human feel. Human sense of time was just an illution created by evolution to detect the difference of movements.
